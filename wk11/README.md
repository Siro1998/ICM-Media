* We built a sample sequencer to jam~~~~~~~
* Click on the buttons on the left to record/stop. Use the sliders to control the pitch(playback rate) of the recordings. Use the sequencer to arrange the recordings and make a composition. The slider at the bottom can control the bpm(speed of the squencer).
